Types of ResultSet
1)TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY: The default type, which allows the cursor to move only forward through the result set.
2)TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE: Allows the cursor to move forward and backward, but the result set is not sensitive to changes made by others to the database that occur after the result set was created.
3)TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE: Allows the cursor to move forward and backward and is sensitive to changes made by others to the database that occur after the result set was created
